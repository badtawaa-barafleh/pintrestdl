This is just a script to get the original size 
so you don't have to manually click download for all of them.
It makes a folder to place the pictures in.

At the moment only public boards are possible.

# Credits

Uses BeautifulSoup,Requests,OS,Json and Random library.

[I got the function for getting nested key values here.](https://ankushkunwar7777.medium.com/get-data-from-large-nested-json-file-cf1146aa8c9e")


# TODO

- [ X ] Get original images from public boards.

- [  ] Better folder name generator so you don't download the same board twice.

- [  ] Authentication to download private boards.
